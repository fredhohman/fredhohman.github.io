Inspired by projects like [Uses This][the-setup], here is the stuff I use.

* TOC
{:toc}

### What's in my Bag
I wear a black [WNDRD PRVKE][wandrd] with the arches red [accessory straps][straps] for office commuting, travel, and everything else.
Before that, I carried a custom [Timbuk2 messenger bag][timbuk2] during grad school.
If I need more space, I keep an ancient [Jansport Classic backpack][jansport] for backup.

Ever since I was 10 I've been writing with [PaperMate Clearpoint 0.5mm mechanical pencils][pencil] on blank computer paper.
More recently I've been carrying a single [Moleskin sketchbook][moleskin] for meeting and research notes.
The size is great for an all-in-one notebook, and the paper in the sketchbook from the [Art Collection][moleskin] is 111lb, which is much thicker than the average Moleskin notebook.[^fn-moleskin]

I also never leave the apartment without a backpocket [Field Notes][fieldnotes] and my [REI carabiner][carabiner] clip to hold my keys.

### Computer
At work I'm using a maxed [2023 14" MacBook Pro][mbp-2023], and at home I'm using the baseline version of the same machine (except upgrade RAM for longevity).
These replaced a [2019 16" MacBook Pro][mbp-2019], which replaced a [2016 15" MacBook Pro][mbp-2016], which replaced a [2011 15" MacBook Pro][mbp-2011], which replaced a [late 2007 20" iMac][imac], which replaced a handful of hand-me-down PCs.

When I'm at my desk I connect to a [LG Ultrafine 5K Monitor][monitor] using a single USB-C cable for power, internet, and peripherals ([Logitech G502 mouse][mouse] and [Code keyboard][keyboard]).

I built my own PC in March 2018 for gaming and deep learning side projects.
It's a high performing (for the time!) Intel + NVIDIA build packed into an excellent midsize metal and glass case.

| Part          |             |
| ------------- |-------------|
| CPU           | [Intel Core i7 8700K][cpu] |
| CPU Cooler    | [Corsair H100i v2 All in One Water Cooler][cpu-cooler] |
| Motherboard   | [ASRock z370 Tai Chi][motherboard] |
| Memory        | [G.Skill Trident RGB 32GB (2x16GB) 3000Hz][memory] |
| Storage (M.2) | [Samsung 970 Evo Plus m.2 PCIe NVMe 1TB][storage-m2-1] |
| Storage (M.2) | [Samsung 960 Evo m.2 PCIe NVMe 1TB][storage-m2-2] |
| Storage (HDD) | [Seagate Barracuda 3TB 7200rpm][storage-hdd] |
| GPU           | [NVIDIA Titan Xp][gpu] |
| Power Supply  | [EVGA 850W G3][power-supply] |
| Case          | [Fractal Design Meshify C (Tempered Glass Edition)][case]|
| Case Fans     | [Corsair LL120mm RGB][case-fans] |

A USB switcher changes all desk peripherals (keyboard, mouse, audio interface, speakers, and microphone) between the Mac and PC setups. 

### Mobile
I'm currently carrying a space black [iPhone 14 Pro][iphone] with a [third-gen 12.9" iPad Pro][ipad] companion.

<!-- <figure>
	<img class="iphone" src="/images/iphone.png" alt="My iPhone Homescreen.">
	<figcaption>My old iPhone 6 Homescreen.</figcaption>
</figure> -->

On my homescreen sits many of the mobile versions of the desktop services I use on macOS, but notable mentions include [Fantastical][fantastical] for calendar and reminders, ~~[Dark Sky][darksky]~~ Apple Weather for down-to-the-minute weather predictions, ~~[Inbox][inbox]~~ Gmail for email, and [Overcast][overcast] for podcasts.

I also wear a gen 5 space gray [Apple Watch][watch] with the red sport band.

### Apps
At any time of day I'm probably listening to music on [Spotify][spotify].
I rely on [Dropbox][dropbox] and [Google Drive][drive] for file sharing.
Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides are also frequently used.
For getting things, I've tried every to-do list and task manager out there, and I haven't really liked any, but I've found that [Things][things] is useful for managing different projects.

~~While browsing Twitter on [Tweetbot][tweetbot] or Reddit on [Apollo][apollo]~~, I constantly save things to my [Pocket][pocket] to read whenever I get a few minutes.
I use [1Password][1password] for saving passwords and [Mint][mint] for tracking money.
[Slack][slack] is always open.

I write journal entries in [Day One][day-one] that contain research notes, a days summary, and interesting quotes and pieces I read.
I've used Day One off and on for a few years, but during the summer of 2015 [I started writing daily entries to log every day of my time as a Ph.D. student][dayone-blog] so that upon graduation I can look back and remember the details, both big and little.
I believe daily writing also helps one communicate more effectively and easily.

### Software
For general programming, and specially for deep learning, I use [Python][python] paired with [Jupyter notebooks][jupyter].
For data visualization I program mostly for the web: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, [Svelte][svelte], and [D3][d3].
For more mathy things, I'll play with [Mathematica][mathematica] (my first programming language!) for continuous problems.

I typeset LaTeX in [Overleaf][overleaf] collaboratively and the [LaTeX Workshop][latex-workshop] extension locally, take notes in Markdown with [Sublime][sublime], and write code in [Visual Studio Code][vs-code].

I use [Keynote][keynote] for slides, [Figma][figma] and [Affinity Designer][affinity-designer] for vector drawing and most digital illustration, with the occasional use of [Pixelmator][pixelmator] for image editing.

When I was working in 3D printing, I used Mathematica and [OpenSCAD][openscad] to generate models, [Blender][blender] for renders and mesh manipulation, and [Makerware][makerware] for print preparation.
[Tinkercad][tinkercad] is also a great, easy-to-use modeling app that runs in the browser.

### Audio
I run audio from my computer through an amazingly powerful and clean audio interface called the [MOTU M4][motu-m4]. It has just enough inputs and outputs for enthusiast setups, beautiful realtime VU meters, and packs a great DAC, sufficient amp, and preamp in an all metal enclosure.

For outputs, one runs to a pair of [KRK Rokit 5 studio monitors][rokit5] with an accompanying [Rokit 10s subwoofer][rokit10].
Another output runs to a dedicated hi-fi headphone amplifier, the [JDS Labs EL Amp II+][jds-element], with a [JDS Labs Subective3][jds-subjective] hardware 3-band EQ in-between for fun.
This amp powers a small set of headphones.
A majority of the time is spent listening from the [Sennheiser 6xx][6xx] with [Audio Technica ATH-m50x][m50x] for backup.
For IEMs, I enjoy the [Shure SE846][shure215], some older [Shure SE215s][shure215], and the cheap but surprisingly great [Tin Audio T2s][tint2].

For inputs, I speak into the renowned [Shure SM7B][sure-sm7b] for all video calling and voice overs, but have a [Blue Yeticaster][yeti] for backup.

### Pen Plotting
I'm an amateur pen plotter but love the craft. I use an [AxiDraw V3/A3][axidraw] which has a nice extended plotting area, and use two sizes of color matched pens from Stabilo: the thinner [Point 88][stabilo-point-88] and thicker [Pen 68][stabilo-pen-68].

### Photography
As an amateur photographer, I'm shooting with a hand-me-down [Nikon D80][d80], but I always have my phone on me to snap a quick picture.
When I was taking macro shots, I'd often set up a homemade light box.

### Drums
I received a [Sonor Force 2001 drum set][sonor] when I was 10, and still play it today.
I play [Sabian AA][aa] and [AAX cymbals][aax] and coated [Evans drumheads][evans].
My drumstick of choice is the [Vic Firth 5A][5a].
For quieter jam sessions, I make less noise on a [Roland electric drum set][roland]. 

### Desk
Given that I sit for a majority of my day, and don't anticipate that changing anytime soon, my first purchase after graduate school was investing in a [Herman Miller Embody][embody] desk chair.
At the office we have the [Areon][areon], which is also great, but I prefer the Embody for home.
For a desk, I use a sit-stand [Fully Jarvis][fully-desk] but only bought the motorized frame.
For the desk top, I bought an unfinished [Hardware Reflections walnut butcherblock counter][wood-top] that's 1.75" thick, and finished it with an oil-based polyurethane to bring out the wood grain with a slight amber hue.

### Entertainment
Aside from my gaming PC, I have the lovely [Nintendo Switch][switch] and an [Xbox One][xbox] that doesn't do much anymore.
A [Chromecast][chromecast] and [Apple TV][apple-tv] are hooked up too.
