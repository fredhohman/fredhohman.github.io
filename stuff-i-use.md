Inspired by projects like [The Setup][the-setup], here is the stuff I use.

### What's in my Bag
I carry a custom [Timbuk2 messenger bag][timbuk2] for just about everything.
If that isn't enough space, I wear a [Jansport Classic backpack][jansport] for backup.

Ever since I was 10 I've been writing with [PaperMate Clearpoint 0.5mm mechanical pencils][pencil] on blank computer paper.
More recently I've been carrying a single [Moleskin sketchbook][moleskin-sketch] for meeting and research notes.
The size is great for an all-in-one notebook, and the paper in the sketchbook from the [Art Collection][moleskin-art] is 111lb, which is much thicker than the average Moleskin notebook[^fn-moleskin].

I also never leave the apartment without a backpocket [Field Notes][fieldnotes] and my [REI carabiner][carabiner] clip to hold my keys.

### Computer
I'm using an upgraded [2016 15" MacBook Pro][mbp], which replaced a [2011 15" MacBook Pro][mbp2011], which replaced a [late 2007 20" iMac][imac].

When I'm at my desk I connect to a [LG Ultrafine 5K Monitor][monitor] using a single USB-C cable for power, internet, and peripherals ([Logitech G502 mouse][mouse] and [Code keyboard][keyboard]).

I built my own PC in March 2018 for gaming and deep learning side projects.
It's a high performing Intel + NVIDIA build with mesmerizing RGB fans packed into an excellent compact metal and glass case.

### Mobile
I'm currently carrying a 64GB black [iPhone X][iphone], with an old, rarely touched [fourth-gen iPad][ipad] resting on its stand.

<!-- <figure>
	<img class="iphone" src="/images/iphone.png" alt="My iPhone Homescreen.">
	<figcaption>My old iPhone 6 Homescreen.</figcaption>
</figure> -->

On my homescreen sits many of the mobile versions of the desktop services I use on OS X, but notable mentions include [Fantastical][fantastical] for calendar and reminders, [Dark Sky][darksky] for down-to-the-minute weather predictions, [Inbox][inbox] by Gmail for email, the data-centric alarm clock [Sleep Cycle][sleep-cycle], and [Overcast][overcast] for podcasts.

I also wear a gen 1 space gray [Apple Watch Sport][watch] with the red sport band.
Necessary? No.
Stylish? Hardly.
Convenient? Certainly. 

### Apps
At any time of day I'm probably listening to music on [Spotify][spotify].
I rely on [Dropbox][dropbox] and [Google Drive][drive] for file sharing.
Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides are also frequently used.
For getting things, I've tried every to-do list and task manager out there, and I haven't really liked any, but I've found that [Trello][trello] is useful for managing different projects; it can also export specific tasks to my calendar while preserving the task’s due date, time, and notes. 

While browsing Twitter on [Tweetbot][tweetbot] or Reddit on [AlienBlue][alienblue], I constantly save things to my [Pocket][pocket] to read whenever I get a few minutes.
I use [1Password][1password] for saving passwords and [Mint][mint] for tracking money.
[Slack][slack] is always open, and [IFTTT][ifttt] can be handy too. 

I write journal entries in [Day One][day-one] that contain research notes, a days summary, and interesting quotes and pieces I read.
I've used Day One off and on for a few years, but during the summer of 2015 [I started writing daily entries to log every day of my time as a Ph.D. student][dayone-blog] so that upon graduation I can look back and remember the details, both big and little.
I believe daily writing also helps one communicate more effectively and easily.

### Software
For general programming, and specially for deep learning, I use [Python][python] often paired with [Jupyter notebooks][jupyter].
For data visualization I program mostly for the web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and [D3][d3]).
For more mathy things, I'll default to [Mathematica][mathematica] for continuous problems and [MATLAB][matlab] for discrete ones.

I typeset LaTeX in [TeXShop][texshop], take notes in Markdown with [Sublime][sublime], and write code in [Visual Studio Code][vs-code].

I use [Keynote][keynote] for slides, [Affinity Designer][affinity-designer] for vector drawing and most digital illustration, with the occasional use of [Pixelmator][pixelmator] for image editing.

When I was working in 3D printing, I used Mathematica and [OpenSCAD][openscad] to generate models, [Blender][blender] for renders and mesh manipulation, and [Makerware][makerware] for print preparation.
[Tinkercad][tinkercad] is also a great, easy-to-use modeling app that runs in the browser.

### Audio
On both sides of my desk sit [KRK Rokit 5 studio monitors][rokit5] with an accompanying [Rokit 10s subwoofer][rokit10].
I run audio from my computer through a now old [Presonus Firestudio][firestudio]. 
For less serious recording, I use a [Blue Yeticaster][yeti] microphone for video calling and voice overs.

I carry [Shure SE846 isolating headphones/earbuds][shure215] with me at all times for excellent sound quality (portable bass!), noise cancellation, and most importantly: they never fall out of my ears.
I have a number of other IEMs, including my older [Shure SE215s][shure215] and the cheap but surprinsgly fantastic [Tin Audio T2s][tint2].
I also carry a pair of the renowned [Audio Technica ATH-m50x][m50x] headphones for sound quality and portability.

### Photography
As an amateur photographer, I'm shooting with a hand-me-down [Nikon D80][d80], but I always have my phone on me to snap a quick picture.
When I was taking macro shots, I'd often set up a homemade light box.

### Drums
I received a [Sonor Force 2001 drum set][sonor] when I was 10, and I still play it today.
I play [Sabian AA][aa] and [AAX cymbals][aax] and coated [Evans drumheads][evans].
My drumstick of choice is the [Vic Firth 5A][5a].
For quieter jam sessions, I make less noise on a [Roland electric drum set][roland]. 

### Entertainment
Aside from my gaming PC, I have the lovely [Nintendo Switch][switch] and an [Xbox One][xbox] that doesn't do much anymore.
A [Chromecast][chromecast] sticks out of my TV too. 

When trying to relax, there is no better companion than an [Eno hammock][eno].
